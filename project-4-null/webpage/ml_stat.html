        <h2 class="heading-39291">Hypothesis 2</h2>
        <p>The severity of the epidemic on people's willingness to vaccinate.The increase in the number of deaths and patients may increase people's willingness to vaccinate.</p>
        <p>We use KNN, Decision Tree, Multinomial Naive Bayes to implement hypothesis 2. Here we believe that the vaccination rate can represent people's willingness to vaccinate.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">KNN</h2>
        <p>Features: the number of positives, ratio of positives, ratio of negatives and number of deaths. </p>
        <p>Label: the people's willingness to vaccinate: very willing to (2), indifferent (1) and very reluctant (0).</p>
        <p>Conclusion:The mean accuracy of hypothesis 2 in the KNN model is 58.2%. This accuracy is not high</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml1.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "950" height = "400"></div>
        <p>The accuracy of people who have a strong willingness to vaccinate is the highest(73%). We believe that this shows the severity of the epidemic may be related to the willingness to be vaccinated, but the willingness to not be vaccinated may be related to more factors.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">Decision Tree</h2>
        <p>Feature: vaccination ratio and ICU beds usage</p>
        <p>Label: the people's willingness to vaccinate: very willing to (2), indifferent (1) and very reluctant (0).</p>
        <p>Conclusion: The accuracy of the decision tree model is 60%. The result supports our hypothesis that when the number of new cases increases, it will lead to people’s higher willingness of vaccination.</p>
        <p>The accuracy of the decision tree model is 60%. The result supports our hypothesis that when the number of new cases increases, it will lead to people’s higher willingness of vaccination.</p>
        <p>The test data of the decision tree</p>

        <p>The result of confusion matrix and the ROC curve of decision tree model</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml3.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "950" height = "400"></div>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">Multinomial Naïve Bayes</h2>
        <p>Features: testPositivityRatio, caseDensity, infectionRate, deaths, positiveTests and negativeTests</p>
        <p>Label: the people's willingness to vaccinate: very willing to (2), indifferent (1) and very reluctant (0).</p>
        <p>Conclusion:The mean accuracy of hypothesis 2 is 40.7%.</p>
        <p>Compared with the other models mentioned above, the confusion matrix and c are not satisfactory. We guess that because the features we use are not completely independent of each other, they may not fit the Naive Bayes model very well.</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml4.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "900" height = "370"></div>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">Hypothesis 3</h2>
        <p>The impact of the degree of utilization of medical resources on people's willingness to vaccinate.The increasement in the number of people in hospitals and ICUs may increase people's willingness to be vaccinated.</p>
        <p>We use SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest to implement hypothesis 3. Here we believe that the vaccination rate can represent people's willingness to vaccinate.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">SVM</h2>
        <p>Feature: hospital Bed capacity, hospital Beds current Usage Tota, hospital Beds current Usage Covid</p>
        <p>Label: Class 0 (inoculation change rate from 0 to 0.023, which reflecting indifferent attitude), Class 1 (inoculation change rate from 0.023 to 0.068, which reflecting very willing to)</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml5.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "900" height = "350"></div>
        <p>Conclusion: Based on this matrix, we find when C = 3, gamma = 0.00001 get the best accuracy. Then, we use 10-fold cross-validation on SVM with a RBF kernel and these two optimal parameters, and we achieve the accuracy to be 74.35%.</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml6.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "900" height = "350"></div>
        <p>Analysis：
            But when we see the results of classification in the figure classification of SVM model, the accuracy to predict indifference willingness(0.79) and a relatively low accuracy on high willingness(0.65), which means the model got a good prediction when people is reluctant to vaccinate but did worse on the situation people are very willing to vaccinate. We thought it indicates that information about hospital resources might not promote people to vaccinate. The relation between medical resources and vaccination ratio might be caused by the fact that the more room in hospital for vaccination, the more people can get vaccinated. If there were many empty rooms for vaccination, it couldn’t motivate people to get vaccinated.</p>
        <p>Fairness:For the SVM model, we also apply the p_precent score to evaluate the fairness of this model. From the features we used, we think the ‘hospital beds capacity’ will cause bias because some small hospital resources are limited which means they can’t provide vaccination for COVID-19. Thus, the ratio of small capacity and large capacity might be extremely low. So, we implement the P score on our SVM model. Because the hospital Beds capacity feature is not a binary feature, thus, we use the mean of this feature to split them into two classes( 0 and 1). And set it as the model’s sentiment feature. Finally, we get p_percent_score= 0.459. It is pretty low and indicates that there might be some bias for the small-capacity hospital.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">Random Forest</h2>
        <p>Feature: vaccination distribution number and new cases</p>
        <p>Label: the people's willingness to vaccinate: very willing to (2), indifferent (1) and very reluctant (0).</p>
        <p>Conclusion:The accuracy of the random forest model is 67%. The result supports our hypothesis that when the usage of medical resources increases, it will lead to people’s higher willingness of vaccination.</p>
        <p>The test data of the random forest.</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml7.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "500" height = "370"></div>
        <p>The confusion matrix and the ROC curve of random forest model.</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml8.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "950" height = "450"></div>
        <p>The accuracy compare with decision tree after 10-fold cross validation. It’s obvious that the random forest model always has a better precision.</p>
        <div><img src="images/ml9.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width = "500" height = "370" ></div>
        <h2 class="heading-39291">Multinomial Naïve Bayes</h2>
        <p>Features: hospitalBeds currentUsageCovid and icuBeds currentUsageCovid.</p>
        <p>Label: the people's willingness to vaccinate: very willing to, indifferent and very reluctant.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: The mean accuracy of hypothesis 3 is 42.1% after ten-fold cross validation.</p>
        <p>From the confusion matrix,we can see that the model does better for class 1 and class 2 classification, which means when we pay attention to the use of medical resources, this model can better classify situations that will lead to strong vaccination willingness.</p>
